# MASK Community Engagement App (Low-Code MVP)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **MASK Community Engagement App**, a digital tool built to empower families and communities with real-time, local, and relevant information related to **education, advocacy, and public resources**.

This app is part of the larger mission of **M.A.S.K. – Mothers Advocating for School Kids**, a parent-led education advocacy nonprofit working to strengthen transparency, elevate family voice, and bridge access to opportunities across school communities.

## ✨ Project Pivot: From No-Code to Low-Code

This repository reflects the **Phase 2 pivot** of the app. Originally prototyped in Glide (no-code), we pivoted to a custom **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** build using GitHub Pages and VS Code due to cost and scalability concerns. This low-code version is community-driven and built to grow with our mission.

## 🚀 Project Vision

**MVP Goal**: To serve as a **Parent Info Hub** that makes it easier for families to:

- 🧭 Find and attend school board meetings
- 🗳️ Stay updated on education policy, legislation, and votes
- 🧠 Learn their parental rights (e.g. McKinney-Vento Act)
- 🗓️ Access school and community-based events
- 📲 Connect with school contacts and administrators
- 🧺 Get visibility into support services (laundry, meals, etc.)
