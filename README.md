# Community Engagement App – Phase 2 (Coding Journey)

---

## 📌 Overview
This repo documents the **next evolution** of the Community Engagement App originally piloted with **M.A.S.K. (Mothers Advocating for School Kids)**.  

- **Phase 1 (Repo: community-engagement-app)** → No-code MVP built in Glide + Google Sheets.  
- **Phase 2 (This Repo)** → Rebuilding the app with **code**, starting small and scaling over time.  

This project is not just about shipping an app — it’s also about **my journey of officially learning to code** while solving real problems in education advocacy.  

---

## 🎯 Mission
To empower parents and communities with **easy access to rights, resources, events, and education policy updates**, starting with M.A.S.K. and scaling to other nonprofits and schools.

## 🧑🏾‍💻 Learning Journey
I come from a product ownership and consulting background (strategy, documentation, PRDs, APIs, Postman).  
Now I’m applying those skills to **build this app step by step in code**, documenting everything along the way.  

**30-Day Starter Plan (current focus):**
- Week 1: Git, JavaScript basics, Postman refresh.  
- Week 2: Fetch API + JSON.  
- Week 3: HTML, CSS, DOM.  
- Week 4: Mini-project → “Parent Events Feed.”  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Phase 2+)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (starting simple → React later).  
- **Backend:** JSON files → Supabase/Firebase (future).  
- **APIs:** Education news, district events, policy updates.  
- **Docs:** GitHub Issues + PRDs (lightweight).
